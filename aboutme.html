        Hi, I’m Seetha! I’m from Tuticorin, TamilNadu, and I am an LDP Intern in Zemosolabs Technologies.
        <br>
        <br>
        I completed my BE in Computer Science and Engineering in the year of 2015.I have a total of 5.8years of working
        experience.
        <br>
        <br>
        I always had a passion to be indenpendent and to get a job in IT industry, Thats when I got an Oppertunity to
        work as a
        Software Engineer in Temenos India Pvt.Ltd Chennai in the year of 2015. I was working under Build and Release
        Domain, where I gained lots of knowledge in my domain as well as in the IT industry.
        <br>
        <br>
        After two years of working there. I got married and I worked for one more year, Then I was in a situation where
        I need to Quit my job due to my maternity. I had my baby boy Shanjai in the year of 2018.
        <br>
        <br>
        After one year of break, taking care of my baby, I thought this is the right time to get back to some work
        related to my field. Thats when I got an Oppertunity to work as a Coding Instructor at Whitehat Jr, I worked
        there for 2.8years.
        <br>
        <br>
        Eventhough I was enjoy teaching in Whitehat JR, Deep inside my heart I wanted to come back to IT industry and be
        successful, but I was worried about leaving my kid for my passion,
        <br>
        <br>
        Thankfully I got the best Oppertunity in life to come back in Zemosolabs Technologies where both my passion and
        family is successful.
