            <p>Tamil Nadu, state of India, located in the extreme south of the subcontinent. It is bounded by
                the Indian Ocean to the east and south and by the states of Kerala to the west, Karnataka
                (formerly Mysore) to the northwest, and Andhra Pradesh to the north. Enclosed by Tamil Nadu
                along the north-central coast are the enclaves of Puducherry and Karaikal, both of which are
                part of Puducherry union territory. The capital is Chennai (Madras), on the coast in the
                northeastern portion of the state.

                Tamil Nadu represents the Tamil-speaking area of what was formerly the Madras Presidency of
                British India. The Tamils are especially proud of their Dravidian language and culture, and they
                have notably resisted attempts by the central government to make Hindi (an Indo-Aryan language)
                the sole national language. While it has an industrial core in Chennai, the state is essentially
                agricultural. Area 50,216 square miles (130,058 square km). Pop. (2011) 72,138,958.</p>

                from the figure of 62,405,679 recorded in the 2001 census. Out of the total population, male and
                female are 36,137,975 and 36,009,055 respectively. Population growth of Tamil Nadu was 15.61
                percent during the 2001-2011 period. The population of Tamil Nadu forms 5.96 percent of India in
